# CS 372:  Java Application Development Homework Assignment 3
HW3: Create a graphical view of the city you created in HW2. That view should include Police, Teachers, Kids, and Zombies. It should not be clear what type a person is, at least initially! There should be a “Speak With” button, a “Skip” button, and a place where some information about the person is displayed. (Said info may be textual or graphical.) On selecting a person (say by clicking on them), display their information. The user can then either select a different person or click on one of the buttons. On skipping all Zombies, the player wins. If they speak to a zombie, they lose, get added to the board as a zombie, and are given a chance to play again – say by another button that gets turned off and on depending on where you are in the game.
